TO DO:
Use image picker gem for new offer page and new slot page(https://github.com/airatdev/image-picker-rails) documentation: (http://rvera.github.io/image-picker/)
Combine slot add and bag edit into one page
Allow for users to search through "my offers"
Require certain discs attributes if the user wants to offer the disc (such as flight numbers and picture)

Disc details on mouseover in disc index and offer details in offer index
Pull flight chart based on disc
Update discs in picture of bag based on color and position
Sort by disc class in discs index
Set up following functionality
