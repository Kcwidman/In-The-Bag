-The idea of sharing to the world what discs a player has in their bag is already proven to be soemthing that has an audience. Pro's make "In the Bag" videos
showing off their discs and talking about how they use each and every one. Being able to have a similar portfolio that you could share with anyone is soemthing
I think a lot of players would be interested in doing. Being able to see how you bag has changed over the years or following your favorite pro's and getting the
inside scoop on what's new when they change their bag are just the beggining draws of the app. 

-Disc golfers often have many discs that they don't ever use. Sometimes discs with the same model and plastic fly in very different ways. Many players buy discs
hoping to find the perfect one, but don't end up liking it as much as they'd hoped. But one man's trash is another man's treasure. Disc golf has such wide variety
of skill level and playing styles. The exact reason you didn't like the disc is the same reason someone else would love it. Setting up a platform for players to
simply trade discs without cost or selling/buying discs would fill a hole in the disc golf world. 

CORE
-A trade and sell page where users can place and fulfill offers
-All discs can be accesed in a library. The library is broken into multiple sub-libraries: bags and shelves
    Shelf: Discs that aren't currently being used on a regular basis.
    Bag: Discs that are being used regularly. Users could have multiple bags if they like, a travel bag, and a home bag for instance.
-Bags or shelves can have a viewable history that shows what the most recent changes were
-Discs have a user uploaded picture, brand, model, run, class (driver, putter, etc.), plasitc type, condition, weight, color, and description
-Discs can be sorted as a full library or within bags/shelves based on certain parameters above
-Sub-libraries will have their own history showing the changes made over time
-Public account pages can be searched and viewed by anyone on the site (included: an option for private pages)

EXTRA
-Discs can be re-ordered by the user using a click and drag feature
-Links can be provided with each disc to flight charts and online sellers
-Ability to follow other accounts and have notifcations if followed accounts change their bags
-Option to upload a picture with multiple discs in view and let the user crop the image into multiple images so they wouldn't have to take 20 pictures
    Thought: maybe it'd be feesible to automate this cropping process?
