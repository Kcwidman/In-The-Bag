The main site navigation will take place through a navbar that will be present on all pages. Things like user account info, logout, and general navigation links. The first of the 3 main pages branching off the home page, will be the user’s bags (bags index). The second main page will be the trading page. From here users can see all the standing trades that have yet to be fulfilled, make a trade offer themselves. The third, a general user page to allow users to follow each other and look at each other’s bags.

In greater detail, bags:
Displayed underneath a list of the user’s bags will be all the discs that the user has that are not assigned to a bag. Each bag will be displayed with a dynamic icon that will be clickable and will link to the show page for that particular bag. This icon will display a generic bag that will be filled with discs based on the colors and ordering of the discs currently in the bag. From the bags index, there will also be an option to create new bags and to add a new disc. When creating a bag, all the discs the user owns will be displayed and can be checked to be added to the bag. When a disc is clicked/checked, an image like the icon described above will update based on the discs added. A disc is allowed to be in multiple bags since oftentimes a heavy wind bag will contain some of the same discs that would be used for a travel bag, for instance. A user can have as many bags as they please. 

In greater detail, trades:
From the main trading page users will be able to see all the standing offers from other users. There will be search features based on multiple attributes allowing users to find exactly what they are looking for. When a user finds what they want, they will have the option to message the user that made the offer. From this point it will be up to the users to communicate shipping details and to trust each other. 

In greater detail, conversations:
What I envision as the biggest use case for messages is communicating for the sake of trading. However, users will be able to message each other for any reason. Users can have many conversations where each conversation consists of 2 users. Each conversation will have many messages.
